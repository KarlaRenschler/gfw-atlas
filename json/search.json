Companies can monitor the impacts of commodity supply chains on forests and demonstrate compliance with sustainability commitments and certifications. Learn more at GFW Commodities.  NGOs &amp; civil society can identify deforestation hotspots and bolster their investigations, advocacy, and campaigns.  Indigenous communities can monitor their territories and raise an alarm when their customary forests are threatened.  Media can gather evidence, data, and graphics for reporting.  Researchers can analyze forest trends on a local or global scale and better understand the causes of forest change.  Concerned citizens everywhere can learn more about the state of forests and participate in forest monitoring. Students and educators can learn more about forests at local and global scales."
